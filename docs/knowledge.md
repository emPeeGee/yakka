Supabase or Watermelon
If you want to use Watermelon DB, its quite nice. It has an offline first approach and a whole section in the documentation dedicated to syncronisation with a backend of your choosing. Its built on SQLite so its all in table form, but you can also save json objects within a column of a table. https://watermelondb.dev/docs
